/** 
    Description
    This class is the base class for all objects contained in an OdDbDatabase instance (OdDb objects).

    Remarks:
    
    Creating and Deleting Database Objects
    
    o  Database objects are normally created by calling OdDbXXXXX::createObject().
       When an object is created, it will be in kOpenForWrite *mode*.  The delete
       operator should never be called on *database* objects.  Instead, erase()
       should be called, which marks the object as *erased*.
    o  OdDbObject instances should be created by calling the createObject() method.
    o  OdDbObject instances are created in kOpenForWrite *mode*.  
    o  Depending on other OdDbObject instances while constructing or deleting instances is prohibited.
    o  OdDbObject instances should be deleted from an OdDbDatabase with erase().
    o  Never access a pointer to a closed object.
    o  The delete operator must never be called on OdDbObject instances. Instead, the erase() method
       should be called, which marks this object as *erased*.
    
    Accessing Database Objects
    
    o  Database objects must be opened before they can be accessed.  
    o  Given a valid OdDbObjectId, a *database* object is opened by calling OdDbObjectId::safeOpenObject().  
    o  Database objects should be opened in the most restrictive *mode* possible, and should be released 
       immediately when access is no longer needed.
       
    Object may be opened in any one of the following modes:
    
    @table
    Mode              Description
    OdDb::kForRead    Allows operations that do not modify this object.  
                      A *database* object can be opened in this mode any number of times (simultaneously), 
                      if has not open in OdDb::kForWrite or OdDb::kForNotify *mode*.  
                      An exception will be thrown if any type of write operation is attempted 
                      on an object open in this *mode*.
    OdDb::kForWrite   Allows read and write operations to be performed on this object.  
                      An *database* object can be opened in this *mode* only if it is not
                      already open in any *mode*.
    OdDb::kForNotify  This object is opened for notification purposes.  
                      A *database* object can be opened in this *mode* so long as it is 
                      not already open in kNotify *mode*.
